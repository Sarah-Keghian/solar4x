# Solar4X

This is a game in active development stage, inspired by 4X space games.

It is designed to be lightweight, modular and hopefully fun! (coming soon)

The idea was proposed by [FrancoisBrucker](https://github.com/FrancoisBrucker), and development started as an internship project by [ben3dninja](https://github.com/ben3dninja).

The game itself is built with the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) game engine, and all the menus are displayed in the terminal using the [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) crate.
